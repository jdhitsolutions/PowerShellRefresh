# PowerShell Summit 2023 Refresher Pre-Conference Workshop

This repository contains the demo material and exercise files from my pre-conference workshop at the PowerShell Summit 2023. You can clone or fork this repository, or click the Code button and download a zip file of the repository.

I recommend opening the exercise files in VSCode or the PowerShell ISE. Write your answers in each region. You can select lines of code and press F8 to run them in the integrated console. After you finish the exercises, go through the labs in the [Practicum](practicum.md).

The other script files and functions are for reference and educational purposes.

I have enabled [Discussions](https://github.com/jdhitsolutions/PowerShellRefresh/discussions) for any follow-up questions or comments.
