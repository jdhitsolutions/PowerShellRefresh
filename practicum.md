# PowerShell Practicum

1. Write a PowerShell script to find all processes with a working set size greater or equal to 100MB and save the process name, ID, working set size, the number of handles, and the process owner to a CSV file. The output should be sorted by working set size in descending order. Let the user specify the name and location of the CSV file. You can provide a default. The script should finish by showing the CSV file directory listing. Then verify you can import the CSV file and display the data in a table.

2. Find a command that will show you information about your network adapters. Write a script that get all connected network adapters and show the adapter name, MAC address, the connection speed, the interface index, the description, and the computer name. Show the computer name with a property called ComputerName. For extra credit, have your script take a computer name as a parameter.

3. Run the script from Exercise 2 and save the output to a JSON file.

4. Take any of the exercises from today and turn them into a PowerShell function that accepts parameter input.
